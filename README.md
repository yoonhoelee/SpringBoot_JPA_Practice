In this repository I aim to practice the following skills.
* Java
* Spring Framework(Spring Boot)
* JPA
* QueryDsl
* Rest API

I will plan to follow the materials on the course accordingly and will produce toy web application while doing so.

## jpa shop
* practicing basic Java language and Spring framework
* Designing tables for domain as well as laying out business logic in service files
* basic understanding of databases(as this is a practice application, an h2 database, which is commonly used for test environments was used)

### errors that occured in the process
* delete 'out' file when css or javascript files are not implemented
* always remember to activate h2 database before running app via "./h2.sh" command in the bin directory
